remember_window_size  yes
initial_window_width  640
initial_window_height 400

#: If enabled, the window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

enabled_layouts *

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value * means all layouts. The first listed layout will
#: be used as the startup layout. For a list of available layouts, see
#: the https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/index.html#layouts.

window_resize_step_cells 2
window_resize_step_lines 2

#: The step size (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when
#: resizing windows. The cells value is used for horizontal resizing
#: and the lines value for vertical resizing.

window_border_width 1.0

#: The width (in pts) of window borders. Will be rounded to the
#: nearest number of pixels based on screen resolution. Note that
#: borders are displayed only when more than one window is visible.
#: They are meant to separate multiple windows.

draw_minimal_borders yes

#: Draw only the minimum borders needed. This means that only the
#: minimum needed borders for inactive windows are drawn. That is only
#: the borders that separate the inactive window from a neighbor. Note
#: that setting a non-zero window margin overrides this and causes all
#: borders to be drawn.

window_margin_width 0.0

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border)

single_window_margin_width -1000.0

#: The window margin (in pts) to use when only a single window is
#: visible. Negative values will cause the value of
#: window_margin_width to be used instead.

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border)

active_border_color #00ff00

#: The color for the border of the active window
