# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, i.e. configurations for various programs and tools. I use
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to orchestrate the deployment of these files
but they can also be used without it. The corresponding playbooks can be found
in [this repository](https://github.com/f-koehler/playbooks-dotfiles).
